Description:
This project is an item-tracking program designed for the Corner Grocer. The program analyzes text records of items purchased throughout the
day, tracks the frequency of each item, and provides various reports and a data backup file.

Features:
- Search for the frequency of a specific item
- Display a list of all items and their purchase frequencies
- Generate a histogram showing the frequency of items
- Backup item frequency data to a file


Functionality:
I am not sure if this structure is entirely efficient or necessary for a program like this. I tried to challenge myself and create classes 
for each aspect. Grocery class is for data management, and the MainMenu class acts as a sort of driver with various components to be called
from main. I tried to set it up in a way that the program can be worked on in parts and scaled up accordingly. I always struggle deciding how many 
functions to create and fear I will over complicate code by giving almost every single action its own function. I hope I struck a good balance with
this program. Even with this small program it took many hours of debugging to make sure data was passed correctly and was able to be accessed when
needed. Sorry for the delayed submission. 

Future Improvements:
- Implement input validation for item names
	- Capitalize first letter of itemName to match case of input data
	- Automatically search data for plural and singular versions of itemName
- Add functionality for custom sorting of data
	- Most sales, least sales, alphabetically
